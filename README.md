Because ASCII ART is awesome, that's why :)

Side project called Spotify Playlist Assistant made in Angular.

## Project description
Spotify Playlist Assistant or SPAtify as I used to call it, is a little project that has two purposes.
* Number one - display all the data that is available to the user via Spotify API.
* Number two - help user to create playlists faster. Using something I called Music Box, you first add all the tracks you want to the Music Box and then select your existing playlist or create a new one. Here comes the best part about this feature - you want to add whole album? No problem. Combine your playlist with another one? No problem as well.
